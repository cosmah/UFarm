 Masajja Division Urban Farming Initiative (Ufarm) Information System

 Brief description of the project.

Introduction
Ufarm is a program initiated by the Agricultural Officer (AO) to promote and support urban farming practices in four urban wards in Masajja Division. Each urban ward has a designated FarmerOne (FO) appointed by the AO to serve as a contact person for mobilization, supervision, regulation, and support. The program only involves fresh horticulture produce, poultry, and dairy products.

Features

The program procedures involve the AO registering the FO by providing their names, ward represented, unique FO number, date of registration, gender, date of birth, activities involved, NIN number, phone number, directions to their home, residence type, and period of stay in the ward in years (must be more than 10 years). The AO can update the FO's activities and phone number and can appoint new FOs but cannot delete past FO records. The FO is responsible for registering urban farmers in their area of administration by providing their names, gender, date of registration, date of birth, activities undertaken, contacts, NIN, ward name, and unique ID. The FO also inspects the produce and approves farmers' produce and products after inspection to be listed to the general public.

Registered urban farmers can upload produce and products by providing their names, ward name, date, unit price in Ugx, quantity, mode of payment, directions, mode of delivery, and produce type. The produce type can either be organic or non-organic, while the mode of payment can either be cash or mobile money. The mode of delivery can either be pick up or home delivery. Once the produce is no longer available, it should be marked with N/A.

The general public can view the listed produce and products' details and book or order them through mail-in order booking or dial-in. Mail-in order booking should be implemented critically, and stakeholders should be engaged to determine the best way to do it. Dial-in involves picking up a phone call and calling directly the produce farmer who has listed the produce or products to the public.

Technologies Used
The system should be implemented using HTML5, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Vue. All forms should be validated to ensure that usernames are alphanumeric and not empty, all names are strings between 5 to 50 characters, NINs are 13 alphanumeric characters, prices are in Ugx, individuals younger than 10 years old cannot be registered as farmerOne, urban farmers, etc., and no form should be submitted when empty. The solution should also use at least one fieldset and consider validating obvious fields such as phone numbers, dates, and characters-only fields..
